Christine Clemens - Third Homework Submission for SCS Coding Bootcamp

### Objective:
To build upon the foundation of existing code to add interactive Javascript elements in order to deliver a fully functioning randomized password generator. This generator is intended to request specific user input, and use this input to successfully provide a unique password that meets these criteria, thereby providing an added layer of security.

### For this assignment, I was required to:
* Examine and interpret the existing code
* Define comprehensive variables for each of the necessary values 
* Code an input prompt requesting password length between 8-128 characters
* Code a confirm prompt offering uppercase characters
* Code a confirm prompt offering lowercase characters
* Code a confirm prompt offering special characters
* Code a confirm prompt offering numbers
* Randomize the values of the selected criteria
* Provide a unique, secure password that is displayed in the text box
* Ensure that the password generation process can be repeated effectively
